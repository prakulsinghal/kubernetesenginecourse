# Kubernetes Engine - Beyond The Basics course 
This is a repo for the Kubernetes Engine Beyond the Basics Course
Google Cloud Platform is growing impressively in enterprise demand. That demand growth requires cloud professionals to be proficient in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Engine. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed, production-ready Google hosted container environment for deploying containerized applications.

Did you know that the demand for Kubernetes cloud native professionals has never been greater historically? Understanding how to utilize Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes Engine will provide an onramp to cloud native capacity utilizing Google Cloud Platform services with Kubernetes.

This course provides participants deep insight into deploying and managing containerized applications specifically on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The course also covers advanced areas such as extending to on premises with Kubernetes on Premises and how Anthos, which is an application modernization platform, can be utilized to extend container capabilities.

This course gives you an understanding of containers and Docker as well as a brief overview of Kubernetes Engine technologies. Detailed coverage of setting up continuous integration and delivery pipelines is discussed. Exercises are provided as well as significant reference materials.

This course is meant for IT professionals such as cloud architects, cloud administrators, cloud developers and DevOps professionals to rapidly obtain a grasp of how powerful Google Kubernetes Engine really is. If you are a customer facing technical sales expert focused on driving revenue then this course will help enable you to be proficient in Google Cloud container technology.

The course has been positioned to provide a significant number of demos and exercises with Kubernetes Engine to provide the participants a tangible use of their time.
